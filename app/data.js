      `I work with Dmitry Mikhailyuk. He is my programming teacher. 
      Firstly, I can say that I learned a lot in programming. How to make a program, how it looks. Now I have an understanding of programming.
      Secondly, together we made a lot of bots from Telegram. It was fun and interesting for me. Now we are making a fun game (roulette). I hope that we will end it. 
      In the end, I want to say that Dmitry Mikhailyuk knows a lot of new things in the industry and has a lot of programming skills.`,
